## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

Include at least 3 wireframes here, adding images or files to your repository as necessary. Format them as a bulleted/unordered list with links to the files. (Please let me know if I need to rescan these as different documents so it will actually be a list instead of all one collection of images.)

* [Link to all wireframes](https://github.com/Jpowderly814/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/P3-Project_Planning/Images/Assignment3byJulie.pdf)


### Project Tracker

Include a link to your public Trello board. Be sure you have user stories added for at least your first 2-week sprint.
